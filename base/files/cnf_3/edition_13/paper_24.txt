Abstract
Using rational motions it is possible to apply many
fundamental B´ezier spline (or B-spline) techniques to the
designs of motion. This paper develops and tests a simple
automatic algorithm for representing C 1 smooth motion of
a rigid triangle 4 in R3 , by means of piecewise parametric
rational curves of degree 2m=2m for some m, when measurements of the positions of the vertices of the triangle 4
at a sequence of times ti ; i = 0; 1; : : : ; n, in R3 are given.
The method presented in this paper can be applied to various problems in computer animation as well as in robotics.
Keywords: rigid triangle, translation, rotation, quaternion,
orthogonal matrix, motion, smooth, rational B´ezier splines,
interpolation, fixed distance

1. Introduction
Mathematicians and computer scientists have developed
geometric algorithms and methods for problems in computer graphics and computer aided design [2], [3]. There
has been, however, no merging of the two fields, Kinematics and Computer Aided Geometric Design. During the last
several years, it has become apparent that the methods of
computer aided geometric design provide elegant tools for
various tasks in computer graphics, robotics and kinematics, especially for the design of rigid body motions [11].
Shoemake [15] was among the first to develop B´ezier methods for motion design. He developed a spherical generalization of the de Casteljau-algorithm to interpolate rotations
using normalized quaternion curves. The idea was extended by Ge and Ravani [4]. They modified the algorithm in
[15] by generalizing the subdivision algorithm of BernsteinB´ezier curve. Kim and Nam [10] gave a method to smoothly
interpolate a given sequence of solid orientations using circular blending quaternion curves. These methods are com-

putationally more efficient than other methods, however
they have many limitations in terms of flexibility.
In order to apply CAGD-methods to kinematical problems,
it therefore seems to be essential to restrict to motions with
only rational point trajectories [7]. Ge and Ravani [5] was
were first who applied rational splines to motion design,
using dual quaternions. A de Casteljau-like algorithm is
formulated, but the influence of the weights of the control points (which are dual numbers!) is very complex.
J¨uttler [7] formulated a more general version of polynomial interpolation. The trajectories of the moving objects
are rational B´ezier curves. He then extend his results [8]
for the construction of rational tensor-product representations of sweeping surfaces with a kinematic net of parametric lines. J¨uttler and Wagner [9] derived the algorithms to
represent the motion as rational B-splines curves. Horsch
and J¨uttler [6] described an algorithm for interpolation of
positions by a rational spline motion. In all these (rational
motion) algorithms are given for the construction of rotational rational curves, translational part are considered to
be splines curves. rotational and translational curves are
computed separately, which is computationally expensive.
One of the principal demands on the result of such a design
process is that the motion should be rational [13], i.e all the
marked points on a rigid body has rational trajectories, but
these motions are not rational in general.
Motivated by these facts, I shall present these spline curves
in such a way that it meet the constraints (interpolation and
distance constraints), imposed on them and are smooth. I
shall then give the method to compute the rotational and the
translational curve as rational interpolants having the same
common denominator. Consequently all the moving points
on a rigid body have rational interpolants and also keep the
distance apart for all t.

coordinate q0 ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 of Q) is a spline function of some
degree m  1 in t^. Then we can see that the elements of

2. Description of Problem

R

From a number of observations of the position and orientation of a moving rigid triangle 4 in space (see Figure 1), suppose positions of its three vertices, i ; i ; i 2
R3 , are recorded at some instants ti ; i = 0; 1; : : :; n.
Smooth functions t; t; t are required to fit the
data in some sense and to maintain some length relationship between these smooth fuctions 8 t.
Our goal here is to give the method for the construction

The general position of a typical point ^ t^ of the rigid
triangle 4 at time t^ with respect to another point ^t^ of
triangle at time t^, can be given by combining a translation
of points ^t^ from its initial position to its final position
with a rotation about some axis.

We are left with the problem of constructing smooth
spline curves.
Let, the curves traced out by the vertices of the moving triangle, be denoted by t; t; t and let
t; t; t are interpolating the points i ; i ; i at
ti ; i = 0; 1; : : : ; n. Assume that one of the curves, say
t, represents the translation of the moving rigid triangle.
Let Qi = i ; i ; i ; i = cos 2i ; sin 2i i be the unit
quaternion, represents the rotation of the triangle at instant
ti , when it is displaced from the first position to its ith position, where i is the angle of rotation and i 2 R3 is a unit
vector in the direction of the axis of rotation through ti .
Let t; t; t and t be piecewise spline functions
interpolating i , i , i and i respectively for all i and
let i i ; i i ; i i  and i i  be the ith segments of
piecewise parametric spline functions t; t; t and
t,ti
t respectively, where i = ti+1
,ti is the local parameter for the ith segments. We arrange the spline functions
i i ; i i ; i i  and i i  such that for k = i; i + 1

4. Quaternion Description of Rotation Matrix
Given the elements of a unit quaternion, Q =
q0 ; q1 ; q2 ; q3 , we can obtain the elements of the rotation
^Rq0 ; q1 ; q2 ; q3  =
matrix R, corresponding to Q [14] as: w

a

tk  = k ; i tk  = k ; i tk  = k ; i tk  = k :
The simplest way to achieve this is take i i , i i ,
i i  and i i  linear in i . Let
t 2 ti ; ti+1 ;
i i  = 1 , i  i + i i+1 :
i i  = 1 , i  i + i i+1 : t 2 ti ; ti+1 ;
t 2 ti ; ti+1 ;
i i  = 1 , i  i + i i+1 :
t 2 ti ; ti+1 :
i i  = 1 , i  i + i i+1 :
Then t; t; t and t are C 0 linear spline curves.
Thus every entry in R t; t; t; t is a C 0 piecewise Bernstein-B´ezier rational quadratic spline in t with
denominator wt = 2 t + 2 t + 2 t + 2 t.
Consequently xt , at = Rtxt0  , at0  and
yt , at = Rtyt0  , at0  are C 0 t0; tn piecewise rational quadratic splines with denominator wt. As

anyhow known values with respect to some coordinate system with origin at O.

By choosing the sense of i to be the same as that of

as tan 2i is infinite. This value of will be considered separately. Other rotations obtained by adding or subtracting
multiples of 2 from this value (of ) produce the same
effect on the particle and may therefore be referred to as
equivalent rotations.
In order to make use of the results contained in the proof of

Replace s2 by Ai B

a = c  ab , b  ac from vector analysis and the fact
that xi , ai , x0 , a0   xi , ai + x0 , a0  = 0, then

which will give us the value of i .
If j i , i , 0 , 0    i , i , 0 , 0 j is a zero for

or both are zero or both parallel to eachother for that value
of i.
In case of pure translation, both  i , i , 0 , 0  and

If one of them say xi , ai , x0 , a0  is zero then the
points Ai and Bi will be fixed after translation di , so we
take Ai Bi as axis of rotation.
If both xi , ai ,x0 , a0  and yi , ai ,y0 , a0  are parallel to each other for any i then the rotation is of amount 
about an axis parallel to the vectors xi , ai + x0 , a0  or

For i = 0 the values of 0 ; 0 ; 0 and 0 are yet to choose.
We choose 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 = 1; 0; 0; 0 such that Rt0  is a

The main disadvantage of using quaternions is that their 2to-1 correspondence with rotations necessitates a preprocessing step, to choose whether the plus or minus quaternion is the appropriate one to use. Keep Q0 fixed then

C 1 piecewise rational quartic spline. Consequently t ,

through each vertex of triangle. The resulting curves are
passing through the given data points, are smooth and also
keep the fixed distance between any two of these curve. The
algorithem can be used for the motion of any rigid body,
because the position of any rigid body can be found exactly if positions of its any three non-colinear points are
known. The method is simple to use, simple to implement,
robust, computationally efficient and cheap. We present a
few numerical examples (see Figure 5–Figure 8) to show
that the resulting rational motions of the rigid triangle in R3
is smooth and natural-looking. These examples shows that
our algorithm is good enough for practical use, but there are
much that can be still be done to improve our algorithms.
